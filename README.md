# Agricultural Performance Dashboard (React)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is an **Interactive Dashboard developed in React** designed to analyze the performance of companies in the primary sector (agriculture). The tool simulates realistic environmental and production data to provide key insights for decision-making, such as crop yield efficiency, water usage sustainability, and financial profitability.

## 🎯 Motivation & Purpose

In the primary sector, companies operate in environments characterized by uncontrollable variables like climate and market fluctuations. The goal of this project is to provide a digital tool that:

1. **Integrates Data:** Combines environmental inputs (Temperature, Rainfall) with managerial decisions (Irrigation, Costs).

2. **Simulates Scenarios:** Uses a stochastic engine to generate realistic seasonal data for different crops (Corn, Wheat, Barley, Rice).

3. **Visualizes KPIs:** Offers clear, interactive charts to monitor **Yield (t/ha)**, **Water Use Efficiency (WUE)**, and **Gross Margin (€/ha)**.

This dashboard serves as a Decision Support System (DSS) prototype, demonstrating how digital tools can optimize resource management in agriculture.

## 🚀 Features

* **Multi-Crop Simulation:** Select between different crops (Corn, Wheat, Barley, Rice) with specific agronomic parameters.

* **Dynamic Data Engine:** Real-time generation of seasonal data based on realistic statistical distributions.

* **Interactive Charts:**

  * *Yield Analysis:* Dual-axis chart comparing Production vs. Temperature & Irrigation.

  * *Financial Analysis:* Bar chart comparing Operating Costs vs. Gross Margin.

* **Dark Mode Support:** Fully responsive UI with light/dark theme toggling.

* **Data Table:** Detailed monthly breakdown of all simulated metrics.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Frontend Framework:** React (Vite)

* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (Utility-first CSS framework)

* **Data Visualization:** Recharts (Composable charting library)

* **Icons:** Lucide-React
